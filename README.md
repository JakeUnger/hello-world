# hello-world
My first repository 

Hi I’m so excited to be going on this awesome journey to becoming a dev! 
I have knack for having a lot of fun doing things and a voracious appetite for getting sh*t done! 
Coding is the most exciting thing I’ve discovered and I look forward to sharing my love for it with everybody.
